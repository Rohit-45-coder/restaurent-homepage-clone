# restaurent-homepage-clone
🍴 A simple Restaurant Homepage Clone built with HTML &amp; CSS. Focused on semantic structure, clean design, and layouting with CSS Grid. This project helped me practice frontend fundamentals and experiment with modern styling. Not fully responsive yet but a step forward in web dev 🚀.
